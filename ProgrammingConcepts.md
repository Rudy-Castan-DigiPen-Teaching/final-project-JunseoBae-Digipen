# Topics
## Shapes
* Shapes are functions which are used for drawing figures, such as `circle()`, `triangle()`, `square()`, `line()`, `point()`, etc.
* Shapes are used when drawing shapes on canvas.
* The reason why shapes are used is because they are fundamental functions to draw something meaningful on canvas, except for text.
* Shapes can be used by giving some arguments to the parameters of shapes. 
  The parameters are usually the position of shape's certain point or the positions of each vertex.

## Colors
* Colors are functions changing shape's charcteristics. Colors can change shape's color, transparency, borders. Colors are basesd on RGB values.(R-red, G-green, B-blue)
* Colors are used to colorize shapes or background usually. Also, they are used when adjusting shape's borders.
* Colors are utilized because they are very useful for adjusting shape's color, borders, and transparencies.
* Colors take different parameters for each function. For example, `color()` can take 1 minimum parameter and 4 maximum parameters.
  * The arguments of colors can be color's name, color's RGB value, or color and transparency value.
  * For borders of shapes, it use `stroke()` mainly. Same as `color()`, it also can take 1 parameter at minimum and 4 parameters for      maximum.
  * `fill()` is used to fill shapes with colors, while `noFill()` is used to remove colors. Likewise, `noStorke()` is used to remove borders of shapes.
