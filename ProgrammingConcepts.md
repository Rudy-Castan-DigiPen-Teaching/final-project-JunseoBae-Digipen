# Topics
## Shapes
* Shapes are functions which are used for drawing figures, such as `circle()`, `triangle()`, `square()`, `line()`, `point()`, etc.
* Shapes are used when drawing shapes on canvas.
* The reason why shapes are used is because they are fundamental functions to draw something meaningful on canvas, except for text.
* Shapes can be used by giving some arguments to the parameters of shapes. 
  The parameters are usually the position of shape's certain point or the positions of each vertex.
